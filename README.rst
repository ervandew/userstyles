Overview
==================

This repository serves as a home for all the user styles I've written for the
`stylish`_ plugin on firefox (though they may work with other browsers as
well).

Note: there is a stylish extension for `chrome`_ as well.

installing a style
------------------

First you'll need to install `stylish`_, then you can open the css file you
want to install in firefox (Example: `github_dark.css`_), click the stylish
icon in the status bar, choose "Install file...", and then follow stylish's
directions from there.
